  # Synfetch
  
A really simple system fetch written in **bash**.

*More features soon.*
</div>

### Why synfetch?

While there are many excellent fetch tools (neofetch, fastfetch, etc.), synfetch stands out by embracing a distinct **synthwave / synthetic** identity:

- Clean, modern layout with vibrant cyber colors
- Cross-platform support for **Linux** and **macOS**
- Fast bash implementation that stays lightweight
- Designed to look great in riced terminals and screenshots

### Features

- Beautiful custom ASCII art
- Displays Info + CPU & RAM Usage
- Blazingly fast execution
- Works on both Linux and macOS

### Support
`synfetch` currently supports **MacOS** and the following **Linux** distributions. However, I have not been able to test them all.
